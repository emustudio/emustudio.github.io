# Installation & run

Unpack <code>emuStudio-[version].tar</code> (or <code>emuStudio-[version].zip</code>) file into location where you want
to have emuStudio installed. The archive file contains the whole emuStudio with all official computer emulators and examples.
 
To run emuStudio, run the following command from the console:

- On Linux / Mac
<code>./emuStudio</code>

- On Windows:
<code>emuStudio.bat</code>

For more information, please see the [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/user/application/).


# Disk images, ROMs, etc.

There exist multiple images of the original software for computers emulated on emuStudio. However, it is not possible to
provide all of them due to potential licensing issues. Therefore, instead of providing the images with emuStudio
installation, we rather list some links to sites that provide those.
