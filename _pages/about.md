# Why another emulator?

A long time ago at [Technical University of Košice][tuke]{:target="_blank"} ([Slovakia][tukesk]{:target="_blank"}) far,
far away...

During first lessons of assembly language, me and my classmates were introduced to vintage computers. We had to create simple programs for Intel 8080, but we had to do it by hand on a paper. There weren't good emulators which allowed simple
'compile-load-emulate' workflows.

The aim of emuStudio is to support "academic process" while keep students interested by giving them the set of working and mature computer emulators. Not only 'compile-load-emulate', but also being able to run original software on emulated
computers. 
 
## History

Project 'emuStudio' started in 2006 as a school project, then a master thesis, created by [Peter Jakubčo][peterj]{:target="_blank"}. He had continued to work on it afterwards, giving it less and less spare time he has now.

Supervisor of the school project was [Slavomír Šimoňák][slavos]{:target="_blank"}, who could be understood as the first "product owner". On a personal note, the original author remembers the times with nostalgy. Lots of good ideas came from discussions between the supervisor and the author.

## Contributing

Everybody is encouraged to contribute. Statistics show that students are main contributors, but from time-to-time some unknown contributors appear as well. And they come from various countries over the world. 

How can you contribute? It's simpler than you think:

- By providing a feedback to author
- Or filling an issue/bug on GitHub
- Requesting a feature
- Help with fixing a bug
- Implement a feature
- Implement new computer emulators
- Supporting the project by buying me a <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/vbmacher" target="_blank"><img src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/bmc-new-btn-logo.svg" alt="Buy Me A Coffee" style="height: 51px !important;" ></a>

## Getting help

If you are seeking for help with emuStudio, you have two options. Preferred way is to raise
an [issue at GitHub](https://github.com/emustudio/emuStudio/issues).
The second option is to write an email to [developers group](mailto:emustudio@googlegroups.com).

Responses to the issues/emails might be slow, as this project is still mostly a one-person show, and it's a hobby.
Thank you for understanding.
