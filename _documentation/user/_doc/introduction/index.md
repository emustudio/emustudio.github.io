# Introduction

emuStudio is a toy-computer emulation platform and framework, targeting mainly academic sphere. A platform, because it
supports full emulation "life-cycle". From writing and compiling programs for emulated machine, to running and
debugging. A framework, because it provides API and documentation which encourages implementing your custom
toy-computer, either real or abstract.

It does not aim to supersede other emulators which try to preserve history (e.g. [MAME][mame]{:target="_blank"},
or [simh][simh]{:target="_blank"}), because they do better job, have big community around them, and it does not make
sense to provide the same goal. Instead, emuStudio focuses on allowing programming the emulated devices - in the style
of "write program - load it into computer - emulate".
