    "content": "Altair 8800 originally came with processor Intel 8080. It is an 8-bit microprocessor, from 1974. The initial clock frequency was 2 MHZ. This processor was one of the first general-purpose and widespread processors, used not only in calculators but also in first personal computers. One of the key roles why this CPU become so popular is that Gary Killdall targeted his CP/M to this CPU; and CP/M was de facto a “standard” in personal computers those days. Main features of the emulator include: . | Threaded-dispatch combined with interpretation as emulation technique, | Correct real timing of instructions, | Ability to set clock frequency manually at run-time, | Emulation of all instructions including interrupts, | Disassembler implementation, | Ability to “dump” instruction history to console at run-time, | Support of breakpoints, | Ability of communication with up to 256 I/O devices, | Status window shows all registers, flags, and run-time frequency. | .

    "content": "The CPU offers a unique feature, which is the ability to dump executed instructions as a sequence to the console. When enabled, then each executed instruction - together with the content of flags and registers values after the execution is printed. This feature might be extremely useful in two cases: . | Reverse engineering of some unknown software | It allows us to build tools for automatic checking of register values during the emulation when performing automatic emulation. | . To enable this feature, please see the section “Configuration file”. For example, let’s take one example which computes a reverse text: . ; Print reversed text org 1000 dcx sp ; stack initialization (0FFFFh) lxi h,text1 call putstr ; print text1 lxi d,input ; address for string input call getline ; read from keyboard lxi b,input mvi d,0 ; chars counter char_loop: ldax b inx b ; bc = bc+1 cpi 10 ; end of input? jz char_end cpi 13 jz char_end inr d ; d =d+1 jmp char_loop char_end: dcx b ; bc = bc-1 dcx b call newline char2_loop: ldax b call putchar dcx b dcr d jz char2_end jmp char2_loop char2_end: hlt include 'include\\getchar.inc' include 'include\\getline.inc' include 'include\\putstr.inc' include 'include\\putchar.inc' include 'include\\newline.inc' text1: db 'Reversed text ...',10,13,'Enter text: ',0 text2: db 10,13,'Reversed: ',0 input: ds 30 . When the program is being run, and the dump instructions feature is turned on, on console you can see the following output: . 0000 | PC=03e8 | dcx SP | 3B || regs=00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 | flags= | SP=ffff | PC=03e9 0001 | PC=03e9 | lxi HL, 485 | 21 85 04 || regs=00 00 00 00 04 85 00 00 | flags= | SP=ffff | PC=03ec 0001 | PC=03ec | call 46D | CD 6D 04 || regs=00 00 00 00 04 85 00 00 | flags= | SP=fffd | PC=046d 0002 | PC=046d | mov A, M | 7E || regs=00 00 00 00 04 85 00 52 | flags= | SP=fffd | PC=046e 0002 | PC=046e | inx HL | 23 || regs=00 00 00 00 04 86 00 52 | flags= | SP=fffd | PC=046f 0003 | PC=046f | cpi 0 | FE 00 || regs=00 00 00 00 04 86 00 52 | flags= | SP=fffd | PC=0471 0004 | PC=0471 | rz | C8 || regs=00 00 00 00 04 86 00 52 | flags= | SP=fffd | PC=0472 0005 | PC=0472 | out 11 | D3 11 || regs=00 00 00 00 04 86 00 52 | flags= | SP=fffd | PC=0474 0006 | PC=0474 | jmp 46D | C3 6D 04 || regs=00 00 00 00 04 86 00 52 | flags= | SP=fffd | PC=046d 0006 | PC=046d | mov A, M | 7E || regs=00 00 00 00 04 86 00 65 | flags= | SP=fffd | PC=046e 0024 | Block from 0474 to 03EF;

    "title": "Programming",
    "content": "Data are written onto/read from a disk serially. The position in the floppy disk is uniquely set by the track number, sector number and the offset in the sector. It is rudimentary to know how many tracks are available, so as how many sectors per track and the sector size. In Altair8800, drive Pertec FD400 used 8” diskettes. Each had 77 tracks. The track had 32 sectors with 137 bytes long. Capacity was therefore 77 * 32 * 137 = 337568 B = 330 kB. Software used less capacity, because 9 bytes from each sector were used for the integrity checksum. Setting the position . Track number and sector number can be set only incrementally, not directly. Setting the offset within the sector is more challenging. After track and sector were set, programmer must “poll” the status port which tells him when the disk position is set to the beginning of the sector. Then, programmer must read data until he gets to the position where he wanted. CPU Ports . Controller communicates with CPU using three I/O ports at addresses (by default) 0x08, 0x09 and 0x0A. The following table shows the CPU ports and how they are used. | Port | Address | Input | Output | . | 1 | 0x08 | Disk and controller status | Select disk | . | 2 | 0x09 | Get number of sector | Disk settings | . | 3 | 0x0A | Read data | Write data | . Now, detailed description of the ports follow. Bits are ordered in a byte as follows: . D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 . where D7 is the most significant bit, and D0 the least significant bit. Port 1 (default address: 0x08) . WRITE: . Selects and enables one of 16 disk devices. By selecting a drive, all further operations will be performed on that drive. If the disk has not mounted any disk image, all further operations will be ignored. The previously selected device will be disabled. | D7 : if the value is 1, disable the drive. If the value is 0, select and enable the drive. | D6 D5 D4 : unused bits | D3 D2 D1 D0: index of the drive to be selected. From 0-15. | . READ: . Read disk status of the selected drive. | D7 : New read data available. Indicates if there is at least 1 byte available for reading from Port 3 (value=0). It will be reset after data are read (value=1). If the value is 1, data read from Port 3 will be invalid or no new data is available. | D6 : Track 0. Indicates if the head is positioned at track 0 (value=0). | D5 : Interrupt Enabled. Indicates if interrupts are used (value=0). The plugin does not support interrupts, therefore the value will be always 1. | D4 D3 : Unused bits; they are always 0. | D2 : Head Status. Indicates the correctness of the head setting. If the value is 0, reading sector number from Port 2 will be valid. | D1 : Move head. Indicates if the movement of the disk head is allowed. If the value is 1, all track number changes will be ignored. | D0 : Enter new write data. Indicates if the device is ready for writing data. If the value is 1, all written data will be ignored. | . Initial values of the bits are: 11100111. Port 2 (default address: 0x09) . WRITE: . Control the disk head, and other settings if a disk drive is selected. | D7 : Write Enable. Initializes write sequence (enables writing to the disk; value=1). The plugin sets the sector number to 0 and also value 0 to bit D0 of Port 1 (Enter new write data). According to manual the write sequence holds only for short time, maximally until the end of sector is reached. The plugin does not limit the sequence period, it is deactivated only when the end of the sector is reached. In addition each first byte and the last byte of a sector should have set its MSB (7th bit) to 1. It was called the “sync bit” for easier identification of start or end of a sector. However, the plugin does not require it. | D6 : Head Current Switch. On real disks the bit should be set to 1 when a program is writting data to tracks from 43-76. The plugin the bit is ignored. | D5 : Interrupt Disable. Setting is ignored sicne plugin does not support interrupts. | D4 : Interrupt Enable. Setting is ignored sicne plugin does not support interrupts. | D3 : Head unload. Removes head from the disk surface. Reading sector number will now become invalid. In addition, value of bit D7 from Port 1 (New read data available) become 1 (no new data). | D2 : Head load. Sets the disk head onto disk surface. Reading sector number now becomes valid. If additionally the bit D7 from Port 1 (New data available) is set, it is possible to read data from the disk. | D1 : Step Out. Move the disk head back by 1 track (the track number is decremented). It is required to check bit D1 of Port 1 (Move head) to have value 0. | D0 : Step In. Move the disk head ahead by 1 track (the track number is incremented). It is required to check bit D1 of Port 1 (Move head) to have value 0. | . READ: . Reads the number of the sector. The value can be read only if a disk drive is selected and the disk head is positioned at the disk surface (by setting the bit D2). | D7 D6 : Unused bits; they are always 1. | D5 D4 D3 D2 D1: Number of the sector, counted from 0. | D0 : Sector True. If the value is 0, the offset in sector is 0. According to manual, the bit is set for maximum 30 microseconds. Programs could detect the bit set and quickly start writing data until the Sector true came back again. It could be made in time easily, because CPU was much faster than disk itself. plugin does not limit the period. The value is 0 practically all the time, until first byte is written. | . Port 3 (default address: 0x0A) . WRITE: . Write a byte to disk. In order to perform valid write, the Write Enable D7 bit of Port 2 must be set to 1. Before data are written to disk, it is required to check bit D0 from Port 1 (Enter new write data). READ: . Read a byte from disk. In order to perform valid read, the Head load D2 bit of Port 2 must be set to 1. Only if bit D7 from Port 1 (New read data available) is set to 0, the read data are valid. Program example . In this section, an example is presented showing how to read/write data from/to the floppy disk. At first, it writes one byte (letter A with ASCII value 65) to track 1, sector 18 and offset 20. Then, it reads the byte to operating memory at address 0x200. The program uses 3 procedures (in assembler for Intel 8080) for setting the disk position (ltrack for loading the track number, lsector for loading the sector number, and loffset for loading the offset within the sector) and two more for data reading (read) and writing (write). disk0 equ 0 ; disk number track equ 1 ; track number sector equ 18 ; sector number offset equ 20 ; offset within the sector data equ 'A' ; data for writing dcx sp ; set stack register to 0xFFFF mvi a, disk0 ; select disk out 08h call ltrack ; set track number call we ; set 'write enable' sequence call lsector ; set sector number call loffset ; set sector offset call write ; write data call lsector ; set sector number (for clearing the offset) call loffset ; set sector offset call read ; read data lxi h, readdata ; load address for reading the data mov m, a ; move the data there hlt ; end ltrack0: ; the procedure will set track number to 0 in 08h ; read disk status ani 1000000b ; track 0 ? rz ; yes, return mvi a, 1000b ; head unload out 09h call movetrk ; wait until the disk head can be moved mvi a, 10b ; step out, decrement track number out 08h jmp ltrack0 ltrack: ; procedure sets a track number call ltrack0 ; at first, set track number to 0 mvi b, track+1 ; b = track + 1 stepin: ; stepin: { dcr b ; b--; rz ; if (b == 0) return; call movetrk ; wait until the disk head can be moved mvi a, 1 ; step in, increment track number out 09h jmp stepin ; goto stepin; ; } movetrk: ; procedure waits until the disk head can be moved in 08h ; read disk status ani 10b ; can the disk head be moved? jnz movetrk ; nope, try again... ret ; yes, return lsector: ; procedure sets a sector number mvi a, 100b ; head load out 09h waits: in 09h ; read sector number ani 3Fh ; clear unused bits rrc cpi sector ; is the number what is requested? jnz waits ; nope, try again ret ; yes, return loffset: ; procedure sets a sector offset mvi b, offset+1 ; b = offset + 1 stepoff: ; stepoff: { dcr b ; b--; rz ; if (b == 0) return; call read ; read data; the offset is incremented jmp stepoff ; goto stepoff; ; } read: ; procedure reads data from the disk in 08h ; read disk status ani 100b ; check if the disk head is loaded on the disk surface rnz ; if not, return waitr: in 08h ; read disk status ani 10000000b ; New read data available ? jnz waitr ; nope, try again... in 0Ah ; yes, read data ret ; return we: ; procedure enables 'write enable' sequence mvi a, 10000000b ; write enable out 09h ret write: ; procedure writes data to the disk in 08h ; read disk status ani 100b ; check if the disk head is loaded on the disk surface rnz ; if not, return waitw: in 08h ; read disk status ani 1 ; enter new write data ? jnz waitw ; nope, try again... mvi a, data ; yes, write data out 0Ah ret org 200h readdata: db 0 .

    "content": "In order to show something useful, let’s assume that a terminal LSI ADM-3A is attached to the board. Remember, the board only mediates the communication, it does not interpret any of the sent/received characters. CPU Ports . Whole communication between the board (and attached device) and CPU is controlled by programming the two ports: Status port and Data port. The following table shows the ports and how they are used. | Port | Address | Input | Output | . | 1 | 0x10 | Read board status | Not used. Originally used for enabling/disabling interrupts. | . | 2 | 0x11 | Read data | Write data | . Now, detailed description of the ports follow. Bits are ordered in a byte as follows: . D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0 . where D7 is the most significant bit, and D0 the least significant bit. Port 1 (“Control” port) . Default addresses: 0x03, 0x10, 0x14, 0x16, 0x18 (preferred is 0x10) . WRITE: . Controls input/output interrupts enable. If both interrupts are set to be enabled, it only empties transmitter buffer in the device, which was a post-step after interrupts being enabled. However, the plugin does not implement interrupts support. | D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 : unused bits | D1 D0 : Used for enabling/disabling interrupts. Not used in emuStudio. | . READ: . Read status of the device. | D7 : Output device ready. Always 0 in the emulator. | D6 : Not used (always 0). | D5 : Data available (for writing to the attached device). Always 0 in the emulator, meaning that no data is pending to be written. Data are written immediately after OUT instruction. | D4 : Data overflow. Value 1 means a new word of data has been received before the previous word was inputted to the accumulator. In emuStudio, this never happens. | D3 : Framing error. Value 1 means that data bit has no valid stop bit. In emuStudio, this never happens. | D2 : Parity error. Value 1 means that received parity does not agree with selected parity. In emuStudio, this never happens. | D1 : Transmitter buffer empty. Value 1 means that the data word has been received from the attached device and it’s available for reading (from the Data port). | D0 : Input device ready. Value 1 means that the CPU can write data to the SIO (that the board is ready). Always 1 in the emulator. | . Port 2 (“Data” port) . Default addresses: 0x02, 0x11, 0x15, 0x17, 0x19 (preferred is 0x11) . WRITE: . Write data to the attached device. READ: . Read data from the attached device. If the attached device sends asynchronously multiple data, the emulated board stores all in a buffer (queue) with unlimited capacity, so no data should be lost and can be read anytime. Program example . In this section it will be shown a small “How to” program terminal using 88-SIO ports. Print a character on screen . In emuStudio, it is enough to write data to Port 2, e.g.: . mvi a, 'H' out 11h mvi a, 'i' out 11h . Print a string on screen . For writing strings, it is more practical to have a procedure. lxi h, text ; load address of 'text' label to HL call print ; print text hlt ; halt CPU text: db 'Hello, world!',0 ; Procedure for printing text to terminal. ; Input: pair HL must contain the address of the ASCIIZ string print: mov a, m ; load character from HL inx h ; increment HL cpi 0 ; is the character = 0? rz ; yes; quit out 11h ; otherwise; show it jmp print ; and repeat from the beginning . Reading character from keyboard . For reading a character, it is required to read the Port 1 until the character is not ready. Then we can read it from Port 2. ; Procedure will read a single character from terminal ; Input: none ; Output: register A will contain the character. getchar: in 10h ; read Port 1 ani 1 ; is data ready ? jz getchar ; not; try again in 11h ; yes; read it (into A register) ret . Reading text from keyboard . Now follows an example, which will read a whole line of characters into memory starting at address in DE pair. The procedure will interpret some control keys, like: backspace and ENTER keys. lxi h, text ; load address of 'text' label to HL xchg ; DE &lt;-&gt; HL call getline ; read line from the keyboard into DE lxi h, text ; load 'text' address again call print ; print the text on screen hlt ; halt CPU text: ds 30 ; here will be stored the read text ;Procedure for reading a text from keyboard. ;Input: DE = address, where the text should be put after reading ; C = is used internally getline: mvi c, 0 ; register C will be used as a counter of ; read characters next_char: in 10h ; read Port 1: status ani 1 ; is the char ready for reading? jz next_char ; not; try again in 11h ; yes; read it to A register ; now ENTER and Backspace will be interpreted cpi 13 ; ENTER? jz getline_ret ; yes; it means end of input cpi 8 ; Backspace ? jnz save_char ; if not; store the character ; Backspace interpretation mov a, c ; A &lt;- number of read characters cpi 0 ; are we at the beginning? jz next_char ; yes; ignore the backspace dcx d ; not; decrement DE dcr c ; decrement count of read characters mvi a,8 ; \"show\" the backspace (terminal will ; interpret this by moving the cursor ; to the left by 1 char) out 11h mvi a, 32 ; \"clear\" the current character on screen ; by a space character (ASCII code 32) out 11h mvi a,8 ; and move the cursor back again out 11h jmp next_char ; jump to next char save_char: ; stores a character into memory at DE out 11h ; show the character in A register stax d ; store it at address DE inx d ; increment DE inr c ; increment number of read characters jmp next_char ; jump to next char getline_ret: ; end of input ; ENTER will be stored as CRLF mvi a,13 ; CR (Carriage Return) stax d ; store the char inx d ; increment DE mvi a, 10 ; LF (Line Feed) stax d ; store the char inx d ; increment DE mvi a, 0 ; char 0 (End-Of-Input) stax d ; store the char ret ; return .

Absolute cursor position from the keyboard . Terminal allows to set the absolute cursor position, when in “Cursor control Mode” or using “load cursor” operation. Emulated terminal does not support the “Cursor control Mode”, but “load cursor” is supported. The “load cursor” operation can be activated by pressing ESC key followed by = key. Then the terminal expects another two keypresses, one representing X, and the other one the Y position of the cursor. X and Y corridnates are translated from the key presses.

Labels are optional. Instructions and pseudo-instructions and register names are reserved for assembler and cannot be used as labels. Also, there cannot be more definitions of the same label. Operands must be separated with comma (,). There exist several operand types, which represent so-called “address modes”. Allowed address modes depend on the instruction. The possibilities are: . | Implicit addressing: instructions do not have operands. They are implicit. | Register addressing: operands are registers. 8-bit general-purpose register names are: A, B, C, D, E, H, L. Stack pointer is defined as SP, and program status word (used by push / pop instructions) as PSW. When register pairs should be used in 16-bit instructions, the same register names are used. For example, DCX D which decrements pair DE. | Register indirect addressing: for the memory value specified by address in HL pair is used special register called M, for example: MOV A, M. | Immediate addressing: operand is the 8-bit constant. It can be also one character, enclosed in single-quotes. | Direct addressing: operand is either 8-bit or 16-bit constant, which is understood as the memory location (address). For example: SHLD 1234h. | Modified page zero: operand is 3-bit value (0-7). It represents a “index”, which is multiplied by constant 8, resulting in final memory address.

The instructions are stored in a memory, which had 32 cells. Each cell was 32 bits long, and each instruction fit into exactly one cell. So each instruction has 32 bits. The bit representation was reversed, so the most and the least significant bits were put on opposite sides. For example, value 3, in common personal computers represented as 011, was in SSEM represented as 110. The instruction format is as follows: . | Bit: | 00 | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | … | 13 | 14 | 15 | … | 31 | . | Use: | L | L | L | L | L | 0 | I | I | I | 0 | 0 | . | Value: | 2^0 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 2^31 | . where bits LLLLL denote a “line”, which is basically the memory address - index of a memory cell.

Labels are optional. Instructions and pseudo-instructions and register names are reserved for assembler and cannot be used as labels. Also, there cannot be more definitions of the same label. Operands must be separated with comma (,). There exist several operand types, which represent so-called “address modes”. Allowed address modes depend on the instruction. The possibilities are: . | Implicit addressing: instructions do not have operands. They are implicit. | Register addressing: operands are registers. 8-bit general-purpose register names are: A, B, C, D, E, H, L. Register pairs have names: BC, DE, HL. The stack pointer is defined as SP, and program status word (used by push / pop instructions) as AF. Other 16-bit registers are defined as IX, IY. | Register indirect addressing: for example, loading a memory value at address in HL pair: LD A, (HL). | Immediate addressing: operand is the 8-bit constant.

    "content": "Random Access Machine (RAM) is the abstract machine, invented to study algorithmic complexity of programs written on register-based computers. It is equivalent to the Turing machine and has a close relationship with a so-called Harvard computer architecture, which has separated storage for program and data. The model implies that it is not possible to modify instructions. RAM machine consists of several parts: input tape (read-only), output tape (write-only), program memory, data memory or registers (read/write) and a control unit (“engine”), as can be seen in the following image: . Input tape acts as a water-tap; the input data can be read from it, causing the input head to move to the next unread symbol. The head can never return to a previously read symbol. Output tape, on the other hand, acts as a sink. The output data can be written to it, causing the output head to move to the next “empty” symbol. The head can also never return to the previously written symbol. Data memory - registers tape - represents the random-access memory. It consists of so-called registers, abstract cells with arbitrary size. These registers are ordered - each one has assigned the index - its position within the tape called the address. The tape head can move arbitrarily up and down - but it has its minimum position. It is the first register, R~0~, called the accumulator. Below there is an unlimited number of higher-positioned registers. The role of the accumulator is kind of special - it often acts as an implicit operand for many instructions, or implicit place for storing the result of such instructions. Program memory is a bounded ordered sequence of registers; each of them is identified by its index within the tape, called address. Data memory is also ordered sequence of registers, but like the I/O tapes - bounded just from one side. Since RAM machine is somewhat abstract, it frees the user from thinking about some issues and just assumes that: . | The size of the problem is always small enough to fit in the RAM memory, | Data used within the computation are always small enough to fit in one register. | . The RAM virtual machine in emuStudio consists of the following plugins: . | ramc-ram: Compiler of the RAM language, very simple “assembler”-like language | ram-cpu: RAM simulator engine | ram-mem: Program memory | abstract-tape: Device which represents the “tape” used in RAM, other than program memory. The abstract schema must define three instances of this device, representing register, input, and output tapes. | . ",

Firstly, it is useful to present Random Access Stored Program (RASP) machine’s architecture – it is schematically depicted in the following figure. As we can see, the control unit, i.e. processor, reads data from the input tape and writes results of executed operations onto the output tape. The tapes serve as a form of I/O devices. The two heads – reading (R) and writing (W), are pointers to the current reading/writing position. As already stated, the RASP machine represents a von Neumann computer. This implies that the operating memory exists as a single unit in which both program and data can reside. The segment containing the program is organized in the way that two adjacent cells contain instruction/operand alternately. The memory can be read as well as written to by the control unit. ",

The only restriction is that compiler must have an output that is compatible with CPU which is currently being emulated. This cannot be checked automatically, users must take care of this. The source code editor supports the following features: . | line numbering &amp; syntax highlighting | undo/redo capability | search/replace text | cut/copy/paste text | CTRL+{mouse wheel} changes font size | . The compilation must be run manually. The compiler output window shows all messages which compiler produces. The content is dependant on the used compiler, but most likely it will contain compilation success or error messages. Compiled source code can produce an output binary file (for example a HEX file), and it’s automatically loaded into the operating memory. If the emulation is running, the user must stop it first manually. If another program is loaded in memory, it is not removed before loading the currently compiled program, but the memory is overwritten at only those locations relevant to the compiled program.

The first one is very useful - listing of operating memory disassembled into instructions. This part is called a debugger window, or “debugger”. The other part, below the debugger window, is a list of all computer devices used (“peripheral devices”). With a double-click, the user can open the GUI window of that particular device, if it supports it. The right part shows the status of the CPU used in this computer. Each CPU has its own implementation of how the status window look and what it displays. Debugger window . Debugging is a process in which a programmer tries to analyze a program, usually with the intent to find bugs. The adverb “to debug” has a deep history. Very early computers were having so-called vacuum tubes, which were core elements acting as electrically controlled switches. From time to time a computer stopped working, and the most usual reason was that a bug (a real one) came in a vacuum tube. Maintainers of the computer had to go there and manually remove the bug. It happened that often so that the process of removing bugs got a name - “to de-bug”.] Debugger in emuStudio contains a debugger toolbar and list of few disassembled instructions from memory. In combination with the CPU status panel, it’s the most powerful tool for seeing (and checking) all internal behavior of the emulated computer. Debugger toolbar . Debugger toolbar contains buttons (icons) for controlling the emulation and accessing memory content. Most of these buttons are self-explanatory. If you hover over those icons, a help text is displayed on how to use the icon. | A: Reset emulation. | B: Set the next instruction position to 0. CPU will perform the next instruction from there. | C: Set the next instruction position to the (current - 1). This action can completely change the displaying of instructions since the new instruction position does not have to be correct in terms of executing the current program. | D: Stop emulation (which was either running or paused). | E: Pause emulation (which was running). | F: Run emulation (which was paused). | G: Run emulation with a timer (which was paused). Instructions are executed after elapsing specified time interval. A dialog will appear to enter the time interval. | H: Step emulation (which was paused). CPU will execute only one - the very next - instruction. | I: Jump to location. The user will manually specify a location (address in memory) for the next instruction to execute. | J: Set/unset breakpoint. The user can set or unset a breakpoint on a specific memory location. When the CPU reaches the breakpoint, it will pause there, waiting for the next user action. | K: Show operating memory. If the memory plugin does not have a GUI, the icon is disabled. | . List of instructions . The largest part of the debugger window a list of few disassembled instructions, so-called instructions window. Around 15 instructions are shown, but it depends on the CPU. They are arranged in a table. The first column is usually interactive, allowing the user to set breakpoints. The red strip is pointing to the very next instruction being executed. The size of disassembled memory (resulting in the number of disassembled instructions) is not configurable. Also, the user cannot change instructions in this place. Sometimes the instructions shown in the debugger do not have to be disassembled correctly. There are two reasons for that: . | first, instructions can have various binary sizes (e.g. one byte, two bytes, etc.) | second, memory can contain programs on various locations, and emuStudio doesn’t know where. Well, if it’s just a program compiled from the source code editor, it knows. | . The implication is that if emuStudio starts to disassemble instructions at the wrong location, the instructions will be disassembled incorrectly, or they can appear as invalid. However, emuStudio is trying hard to find the nearest program start location at which it’s safe to start disassembling. Usually, it’s just a few instructions back, so it is a fast process. Controlling of displaying the instructions . By default, instructions window points to the next instruction with a few instructions before and after the current one. This set of instructions is called an “instructions window”. The instruction window has it’s starting and ending offset in memory. It is possible to move the window to forwards or backward, in a per-page fashion. A toolbar below the instructions list contains controls to control the instruction window pages. | A: Go to the first page. The very first row corresponds to instruction position 0. | B: Go backward. The user will specify the number of pages for going back. | C: Go to the previous page. | D: Go to the page where the current instruction position is. | E: Go to the next page. | F: Go forwards. The user will specify the number of pages for going forward. | . ",

Each input is one word - it might be any number or string. By default, every cell in the input tape is a string, and it is not interpreted as some data type. It is only in a time when it is used - the instruction which works with the cell defines of which “type” it should be. For example, the input section might be: . &lt;input&gt; 1 2 3 hello world! . In this case, there are five inputs: numbers 1,2,3, then word “hello” and the last one is “world!”. Instructions section . There exist many possible formats or variations of RAM instructions, unfortunately, the syntax is not very unified. I guess the reason is that RAM is not a real machine, and for the purposes of the algorithm analysis the machine is so simple that it’s description is repeated in almost every paper where it appears. For this reason, the instructions format or the whole vocabulary might be different from what you expected or used for. We have to live with it, but the differences are really small. Instructions should follow the Input section, but the sections can be mixed. It is just good practice to have input separated from the code. Each instruction must be on a separate line, in the form: . [LABEL:] INSTRUCTION [; optional comment] . Each instruction position can be optionally labeled with some identifier (LABEL field), followed by a colon (:) character. The labels can be then referred to in other instructions. Comments begin with a semicolon (;) character and continue to the end of the line. There are no multi-line comments. Instructions consist of the operation code and optional operand, separated with space ( ). Operation code is expressed as an abbreviation of corresponding operation (e.g. SUB for SUBtraction). An operand can be one of three types: constant (=i), direct operand (i), where i specifies the register index on tape and indirect operand (*i), where the address of operand specified is stored in register R~i~. The following table describes all possible instructions, usable in the RAM simulator: . | Instruction | Constant (=i) | Direct (i) | Indirect (*i) | . | READ |   | R~i~ &lt;- next input |   | . | WRITE | output &lt;- i | output &lt;- R~i~ | output &lt;- M&lt;R~i~&gt; | . | LOAD | R~0~ &lt;- i | R~0~ &lt;- R~i~ | R~0~ &lt;- M&lt;R~i~&gt; | . | STORE |   | R~i~ &lt;- R~0~ | M&lt;R~i~&gt; &lt;- R~0~ | . | ADD | R~0~ &lt;- R~0~ + i | R~0~ &lt;- R~0~ + R~i~ | R~0~ &lt;- R~0~ + M&lt;R~i~&gt; | . | SUB | R~0~ &lt;- R~0~ - i | R~0~ &lt;- R~0~ - R~i~ | R~0~ &lt;- R~0~ - M&lt;R~i~&gt; | . | MUL | R~0~ &lt;- R~0~ * i | R~0~ &lt;- R~0~ * R~i~ | R~0~ &lt;- R~0~ * M&lt;R~i~&gt; | . | DIV | R~0~ &lt;- R~0~ / i | R~0~ &lt;- R~0~ / R~i~ | R~0~ &lt;- R~0~ / M&lt;R~i~&gt; | . | JMP |   | IP &lt;- i |   | . | JZ |   | if R~0~ == 0 then IP &lt;- i |   | . | JGTZ |   | if R~0~ &gt; 0 then IP &lt;- i |   | . | HALT |   | halts the simulation |   | . The table describes also the behavior of each instruction. The compiler does not care about the behavior, but about the syntax of the instructions, which is also incorporated in the table. For example, this is a valid program: . ; COPY(X,Y) ; ; input: X -&gt; r1 ; Y -&gt; r2 ; ; output: X -&gt; Y ; Y -&gt; Y &lt;input&gt; 3 4 world hello &lt;input&gt; sss ; load X,Y read 1 read 2 ; load r.X, r.Y read *1 read *2 ; copy load *2 store *1 halt .

The program start definition must be the first line of the source code. Please, do not place any empty lines before it. Here, an example follows: . org 5 . WARNING: If you do not specify the program start address, or if you set it to 0 (org 0), the default value will be used, which is 20. The compiler will warn you about this, so do not worry. Setting program start to 0 is not allowed as register R0 is used as the accumulator and therefore any instruction written here would be overwritten sooner or later. Supported instructions . All RASP emulator supported instructions together with their semantics are available in the RASP CPU documentation. There are three types of operands of those instructions: . | register - e.g. READ 1 | constant - e.g. WRITE =2 - you specify that operand of instruction should be interpreted as a constant by the = character. | label, which is the operand of jump instructions (JMP, JZ, JGTZ), e.g. JMP *label* | .

Then a grey temporary line is being drawn having its end at the mouse position and moving with the mouse move. If the element is not really close, the user can make a “path” by clicking somewhere in the schema. At those locations, fixed-points are created. When a user clicks at the second element, the temporary line disappears, and a real connection line is created. The user can find the fixed-points later and move them by dragging.

Subsequent versions added multi-user variants and they were ported to 16-bit processors. The combination of CP/M and computers with S-100 bus (8-bit computers sharing some similarities with Altair 8800) was big “industry standard”, widely spread in 70’s up to 80’s years of twentieth century.

ROM areas and memory bank-switching is explained in the following sections. ROM areas . Some “controllers” - used as embedded devices - usually logically organize memory into areas, some of which are read-only, which usually contains the firmware, and some are rewritable. Physically, these memories are wired to specific addresses, so the programmer can access them. The standard operating memory plugin emulates this behavior. It allows us to define ROM areas that represent read-only memory. There can be set up multiple ROM areas, and they can overlap. Effectively it means that memory cells in the ROM area cannot be changed from software running on the emulator. All writes to the memory will be ignored. Manually, as a user, it is possible to change the values, but only by loading a new memory image. Editing the value will not work. If a ROM range is defined, it is possible to remove only a part of it, effectively splitting the range and correcting their boundaries. For example, if there is defined a ROM range from 0x0A - 0x64 (see the image above), then it is possible to remove a range e.g. 0x32 - 0x46, which is the part of defined ROM area. Then, the original ROM area is split into two parts - first will be a range from 0x0A - 0x31, and the second from 0x47 - 0x64. Memory bank-switching . This technique was invented as a workaround for a problem when the address space of a processor was smaller than memory size. To overcome this issue, memory was logically split into many regions of size equal to the processor address space. These regions are called “banks”. Physically, banks could refer to the same memory, but they could be also different memories (e.g. external cartridges), and the bank-switching involved switching the active memory. Selecting a bank from a programming perspective was usually done by writing some code to some I/O port using some I/O instruction of a CPU. But it can be implemented in various ways, e.g. some memory addresses can be used for selecting a bank. Also, it was very common that some part of the address space still kept some common memory part which was never switched out. This part is called a “common” part. In emuStudio, common part starts with the Common address (as it can be seen in the Settings dialog image above) and ends till the rest of the CPU address space (or memory end). To summarize, let’s consider an example. If a CPU is 8-bit, it means it has address space of size 2^8 - i.e. it can access memory from address 0 to (2^8 - 1). If the memory was larger, CPU just doesn’t allow to access higher memory cells. So memory bank-switching is coming for the rescue. If the memory has 2 MB, we require 2^log2(2MB) = 2^21 addresses. So, if we won’t have any common address space, we require ceil(21 / 8) = 3 banks: . | bank 0: maps from 0 - (2^8 - 1) | bank 1: maps from 2^8 - (2^16 - 1) | bank 2: maps from 2^16 - (2^21 - 1) | . ",

The dump format consists of lines, each line represents one instruction execution. The line is separated by | chars, splitting it into so-called sections. Sections before the sequence || represent the state before instruction execution, and sections after it represent the state after instruction execution. Particular sections are described in the following table. | Column | Description | . | 1 | Timestamp from program start (seconds) | . | 2 | Program counter before instruction execution | . | 3 | Disassembled instruction | . | 4 | Instruction opcodes | . |   | Now follows the state after instruction execution | . | 5 | Register values (B, C, D, E, H, L, reserved (always 0), A) | . | 6 | Flags | . | 7 | Stack pointer register (SP) | . | 8 | Program counter after instruction execution | .
